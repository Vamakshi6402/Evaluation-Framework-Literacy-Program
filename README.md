# Independent Evaluation Framework for a Digital Literacy Program  
### Applied Economics · Impact Evaluation · KPI Architecture

**Author:** Vamakshi Chaturvedi  
**Role:** Independent Researcher (Applied Economics)  
**Period:** November 2025  

This repository presents an independently developed Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework for a digital literacy intervention implemented in low-resource primary schools.  
The work demonstrates end-to-end structuring of an evaluation system, including outcome indicators, KPI architecture, baseline/post-assessment logic, and a data-collection template for tracking student literacy progress.

The framework is designed to reflect real-world impact-measurement practice in development programs while showcasing analytical abilities required in applied economist roles.

# Independent Evaluation Framework for a Digital Literacy Program  
### **Applied Economics · Impact Evaluation · KPI Architecture**

**Author:** Vamakshi Chaturvedi  
**Role:** Independent Researcher (**Applied Economics**)  
**Period:** November 2025  

This repository presents an independently developed **Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework** for a digital literacy intervention implemented in low-resource primary schools.  
The work demonstrates end-to-end structuring of an evaluation system, including **outcome indicators**, **KPI architecture**, **baseline/post-assessment logic**, and a **data-collection template** for tracking student literacy progress.

The framework showcases analytical abilities required in **applied economist** and **impact-evaluation** roles across policy and technology sectors.
